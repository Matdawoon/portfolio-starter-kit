  This is how I use Hydejack on my personal site. 
  Much of the development is informed from my experience of using it myself, creating a tight feedback loop.

While I love the font used for Hydejack's headings, for my personal site I felt less of a need to control the typesetting.
That's why I'm not using Google Fonts, and instead use whatever is the default for the reader's operating system.
